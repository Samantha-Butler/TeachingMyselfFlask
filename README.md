# Hello fellow Flask explorer! (Or potential employer!)

I am Samantha and have started this repository to document my journey using Flask. 

## What am I looking to achieve here?

To continue to develop my understanding of Python, I wanted to know how I could integrate this knowledge in a backend form. So naturally, websites! In order to this there are many things involved: Flask, API's, databases, HTML, CSS, JaveScript, templates, Bootstrap... You get the point! 

I don't endevour to learn **all** these elements, simply the basics so I can see how they are merge together to create something as a whole. 

## Next steps:

- Learn decorators and routes
- Begin to understand how Flask interacts with Python
- Add databases into my projects
- Use basic HTML to format
- Use bootstap/templates to assist with CSS and design
- Create various projects via tutorials, ultimately leading to creating one from scratch
- Create a real website in the long distant future accessible to others
